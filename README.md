# insight-email

Here is an email template that needs a CSS inliner to work on different email platforms. But I think I'd rather code the CSS inline. I followed a YouTube video to see what others have done and it was a good learning experience. You'll also notice many styles in the head of this email and I like to leave that space for media querries. It looks nice though and I enjoyed the tutorial.
